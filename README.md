CODE CHALLENGE 2
This is my repository for my week two code challenge. It contains solutions for each of the three questions. The project contains 6 files of which out of the 6, 3 are solutions, one is a readMe file, one is a index.html file containing the solutions on the console and a package lock json file.
# description
This project contains 3 solutions. One of them is a swapp case solution that swaps the cases of letters in a string, the second solution is a function creating a new array using two numbers as inputs and the third solution is a function that extracts prime numbers from an array of numbers.
# project setup
To run the solutions simply change the parameters of each major function.
